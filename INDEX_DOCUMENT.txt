I currently have two indexes on wTeam and lTeam in the games collection.
These indexes were created through MongoDB Atlas.
They benefit two main functions:
    1. Updating the wins and elimination status of each team after it has been involved in the creation or editing of a game.
    2. Generating the report based on a single team.

For both of these, it benefits those functions by:
    - Increasing the speed at which the query can find games that involve a certain team
    - Reducing the number of page IOs

I believe these are the two most efficient indexes for my website because of how frequently certain games involving specific teams are needed to be found.
